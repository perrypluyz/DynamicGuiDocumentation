# Introduction to Functions

Functions are the fundamental building blocks of DynamicGui and are an essential part to what makes DynamicGui truly dynamic. Function sections can be written to be as simple or complex to suit your needs. To understand the different functions and their syntax, we must first understand their base principle.

> *Note: The function name when used within the required syntax is not case-sensitive. For example, you could type the function ```'CopyBackMetadata``` alternatively as: ```copybackmetadata```, ```COPYBACKMETADATA```, or even ```cOPYbACKmETAdATA```. The function names were written in this documentation to improve readability.*
