# DynamicGUI Wiki Updates

### ‎

## **The Dropdown Update**
24-JAN-2025

This update consists of dividing the Functions page into multiple pages for added convenience.

1. *Introduction page* which homes the description of functions.
2. *Function Anatomy* page which homes the anatomy of Top-Level and Slot-Level functions.
3. *List of Functions* page which homes all of the available function DynamicGUI offers.
4. *List of Functions* page also now has better spacing between sections of each Section type.

We have also incorporated a *Wiki Updates* page to provide a more cohesive breakdown of changes from update-to-update, and added a dark-mode option which can be found on the right side of the blue ribbon above.

***Note: No functional changes were made to the DynamicGUI plugin.***
